# Web Attack Detection with Splunk and Docker
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Security Operations Center (SOC) within a containerised environment. Using Docker, a vulnerable web application (DVWA) was deployed alongside a SIEM (Splunk). The objective was to simulate a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack and develop detection queries using Splunk Processing Language (SPL) to identify the threat within the web server logs.
